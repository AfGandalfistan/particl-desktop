> *"Particl is an open source project that aims to restore the balance of privacy on the internet."*

We provide a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to enhance your online privacy:

* **An anonymous cryptocurrency** – send and receive the PART cryptocurrency without revealing the transaction history
* **End-to-end encrypted messaging** – communicate in a secure and decentralized manner without revealing your IP address
* **A private marketplace** – buy and sell goods without leaving a trace

This repository is the user interface that works in combination with our [`particl-core`](https://github.com/particl/particl-core).
